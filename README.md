**Code Management
Objective:**
The first screen will show lists of upcoming and popular movies from TMDB API in one screen.
You first need to sign up here to get an API key. - Signed In and the API key is updated here in the code.
The second screen will show the details of the movie. 
Users should be able to toggle movies as favorites on both screens (Not necessary to make API calls. Updating the favorite flag in the local DB is enough).
UI states(loading, error [both presenting and retrying], etc) should be handled properly.
Also, add offline support and go offline-first approach when showing data (Show offline data first if any while loading data from the API).
Used Reactive Programming concept.
